# forkserf-binaries
precompiled binaries for Forkserf

* use glibc2.6 binaries for older linux distros, ex. CentOS7/RHEL7.  This is the version I play myself.
* use glibc3.4 binaries for newer linux distros, ex. Ubuntu 20.  Untested, let me know if they work
* Windows binaries have been tested on Windows7 64bit only, others untested.
